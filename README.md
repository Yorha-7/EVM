# Electronic Voting Machine
## this project is a refrence from a prfessor from a NIT in india. though voting machine on fpga is not a big deal though i was curious about one thing that was in his paper.
 making a secured voting machine. So I thought, lets make one. umm not the voting machine, The security algorithm, this repo is like a tour to world of encryption and security.
 i will achive two basic thigs in this, first i will explore a domain i was unawre of, that is the security and {might} i will make myself my own algoritmh of encryption, though it sound so stupid.
 i am really hoping to get to a summer interns by the end of the year. hope my work is enough!
